              I am working on an LLVM module which can automatically summarize functions of a program with respect to a specific instruction (for example free(ptr)). The summaries contain the information of just the path which is required for the execution of the given instruction in terms of parameters of the function and global variables. We are currently verifying the output of the module on various Coreutils programs.

        I along with Devashish Yadav implemented an application using Flask which enables a group of people to share files among themselves. The application is based on peer to peer protocol where each client connected to the group is responsible for sending and receiving files and other important information such as active and inactive clients, shared file lists etc.

            <h1>Memory Access Scheduling Algorithm</h1>

        I implemented a scheduling algorithm for DRAM to reduce the program execution time by improving the row buffer hits and also keeping in mind the fairness between the threads. The implementation was done on memory simulator USIMM which reduced the execution time by 3% and the energy delay product by 6% as compared to the FCFS algorithm for the given workload.

        I along with Shubham jain, Aayush Ojha and Amit Kumar implemented an end-to-end compiler for a subset of Java language for x86 architecture. We implemented a lexical analyzer, Machine Code Generator and grammer rules for parsing in python. The developed compiler supports all basic operations, iterative statements, conditional statements, nested loops, functions with recursion support, function overloading, handling variable scopes and multidimensional arrays.
